# MOVE Development VM Scripts

This directory contains scripts and configurations for the MOVE Development VM.

We no longer maintain an installation guide here on Github.  For installation instructions, see the [MOVE Developer Handbook (internal-only)](https://www.notion.so/bditto/MOVE-Developer-Handbook-182de05ad8a94888b52ccc68093a497a).

At this time, our team doesn't have the resources necessary to support external teams looking to install or help develop MOVE.  We're a small team, and our first priority is to support our users and stakeholders at the City of Toronto.
