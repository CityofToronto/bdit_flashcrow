# MOVE Tests

The `tests` folder contains, well, tests!

- `tests/jest`: tests written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), a JavaScript testing framework;
  - `tests/jest/api`: REST API tests (mostly for `lib/controllers`);
  - `tests/jest/db`: database tests (mostly for `lib/db`);
  - `tests/jest/unit`: unit tests (for various things in `lib`, `src/lib`).

We're still working to define a testing strategy, which you can see in [Testing Process](https://www.notion.so/bditto/Testing-Process-f22e9477a20d4847a3038e14d8512594).
